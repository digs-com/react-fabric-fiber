    <code>react-fabric-fiber</code>
</h1>

react-fabric-fiber is a [React renderer](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/codebase-overview.html#renderers) for [Fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com/).

## Inspiration

Much of this work was based on the excellent work of `@pmndrs`'s [`react-three-fiber`](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber). If you're in need of a full 3D renderer, please go check it out!
