import { TabItem, Tabs } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Installation

Before we begin, you need to make sure you've installed all the dependencies.

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm install react-fabric-fiber fabric
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm add react-fabric-fiber fabric
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="yarn">

```sh
yarn add react-fabric-fiber fabric
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Creating the Canvas

Now that you have all the dependencies installed, you can create your first canvas.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Canvas } from "react-fabric-fiber";

export default function App() {
  return <Canvas></Canvas>;
}
```

By default, the `<Canvas>` will attempt to fill the parent container. If you want to create a canvas with a specific size, we recommend wrapping the `<Canvas>` in a `<div>` and setting the size of the `<div>`.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Canvas } from "react-fabric-fiber";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ width: 400, height: 400 }}>
      <Canvas></Canvas>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Adding Elements

Now that you have a canvas, we can start adding elements to it. Let's add a simple rectangle.

```jsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <fabricRect width={200} height={200} fill="red" />
    </Canvas>
  );
}
```

### What Just Happened?

Under the hood, `react-fabric-fiber` took the following steps:

1. Create a new `HTMLCanvasElement`
1. Create a `new fabric.Canvas()` and attach it to the `HTMLCanvasElement`
1. Calculates the size needed to fill the parent container, and updates the `fabric.Canvas()` to match the size.
1. Create a `new fabric.Rect({ width: 200, height: 200, fill: "red" })` and adds it to the `fabric.Canvas()`.

:::note
Note that these are all vanilla `fabric.js` calls! Anything that you can do in `fabric.js`, you can do in `react-fabric-fiber`.
:::

## Updating Element Properties

You can update the properties of an element by simply updating the props.

```jsx
export default function App() {
  const [fill, setFill] = React.useState("red");
  const toggleFill = () => setFill(fill === "red" ? "blue" : "red");

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={toggleFill}>Toggle Fill</button>

      <Canvas>
        <fabricRect width={200} height={200} fill={fill} />
      </Canvas>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Element Update Algorithm

:::caution
`react-fabric-fiber` will only update the properties of an element if they change
:::

To illustrate this, consider the following:

```jsx
export default function App() {
  const [height, setHeight] = React.useState(0);
  const togglePosition = () => setHeight(height === 0 ? 200 : 0);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={toggleHeight}>Toggle Position</button>

      <Canvas>
        <fabricRect top={height} left={0} width={200} height={200} />
      </Canvas>
    </>
  );
}
```

Try clicking the "Toggle Position" button. You'll notice that the rectangle's verticle position changed, as expected.

Now try dragging the rectangle around before toggling the position. You'll notice that the verticle position of the rectangle updated as expected, but the horizontal position did not (despite having a `left` value of `0`)! This is because the horizontal position (`left`) was never updated, and thus was not updated on the underlying object.

## Next Steps

You've just created your first canvas and added a rectangle to it! From here, you can start adding more elements, and even start adding interactivity to your canvas. We recommend starting by exploring the various elements and properties that `react-fabric-fiber` supports. See the [Elements API Reference](/api/interfaces/fabricelements/) for a complete list of supported elements.
